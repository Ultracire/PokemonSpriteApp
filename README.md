<h1 align="center">Pokemon Sprite App</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built pokemon web app to view your favorite pokemon's shiny versions.</h3>



### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###
#### Some Notes:
- This app was made using PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ 
- The app supports 900+ pokemon, which are featured in the main series games.


#### Tech Stuff:
- This webapp was created and designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- I used Math.random() along with some CSS to create a sleek 'Feelin' Lucky?' button: you can generate random Pokemon with this!


#### Future Improvements:
- I may tweak the CSS in the future to make the site more interactive, but the minimalist design does the job for now.
- Adding an algorithm to change the color of the site to match the Pokemon's type.
